### What is libft?
[Libft][1] is an individual project at [42][2] that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

We re-create these functions in order to deepen our understanding of C. The general philosophy of 42 is that it's best to fully understand that machine that you're using and how it all works together. As a result, we avoid treating even these basic functions as black-boxes.

### What's it do?

As you can see from the [Project instructions][1], there are 4 sections:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for later projects
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for linked lists
4.  **Personal Functions:** Functions I find useful.

Libc functions | Additional functions | Bonus Functions | Personal Functions
:----------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | -----------:
memset		| ft_memalloc	| ft_lstnew		| ft_count_words

Notes:

- All the files and functions are namespaced with an **ft_** in front. It stands for Fourty Two
- The project instructions require that we put all the source files in the root directory.

### How does it work?

The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at 42.

To create that library, after downloading/cloning this project, **cd** into the project and call make:

	git clone https://github.com/Matt-Hurd/42-libft
	cd libft
	make

You should see a *libft.a* file and some object files (.o).


Now to clean up (removing the .o files), call `make clean`

### How do I use the library?

When compiling, you have to tell the file where your library resides and which library it is using:

`gcc -L. -lft -o example.out example.c`

-L takes the path to your library. `.` in this case<br>
-l takes the name of your library. This is the set of characters that come after `lib` in your library name.

That's it. Now run it using `./example.out`

## Example usage

This is a list of my projects that use Libft extensively:

### How did you make this sick README?

It was **heavily** inspired by my friend [R4meau][1].
